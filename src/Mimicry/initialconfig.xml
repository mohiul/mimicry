<!--
This file contains initial configuration information of the 
agents of Mimicry silumation.

<root></root>:
This is the standard root tag of the XML file.

<agents></agents>:
This tag contains information regarding the population
of agents present at the initial stage of the simulation.
Only one occurance of this tag is allowed.

<prey></prey>:
Contains information about each category of prey species.
Multiple occurances of this tag is allowed depending the 
number of category of prey species to be present in the 
initial configuration.

<rule></rule>:
This is the Cellular Automata rule with which the prey
species will be constructed. Varies from 0 to 255, 
first 8 bits of the prey genome.

<population></population>:
Population of prey species of the category specified.
Can vary from 0 to infinity. Depending of this value the population
of prey species in each cell will be evenly distributed according to 
the specified location index.

<palatability></palatability>:
This tag defines the palatability behavior of the prey species
of the specific category.

<location><from>0</from><to>53</to></location>:
Index location of the category of prey in the model. It can vary
from 0 to 215 depending on the value of the variable System::ISIZE.
If ISIZE = 6 then location index can vary upto ISIZE^3-1.

<predator></predator>:
Similar to the prey tag the predator tag contains location and population
information. Multiple occurance of this tag is allowed. The population
of predator is evenly distributed all over the location mentioned.
